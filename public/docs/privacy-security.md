# Privacy & Security

## Overview

Security is paramount when dealing with blockchain assets. This guide covers best practices for keeping your tokens, NFTs, and wallet secure.

## Wallet Security

### Choosing a Secure Wallet

**Recommended Wallets:**

1. **Hardware Wallets** (Most Secure)
   - Ledger Nano S/X
   - Trezor
   - Offline key storage
   - Best for large holdings

2. **Software Wallets** (Convenient)
   - Phantom
   - Solflare
   - Backpack
   - Good for daily use

3. **Mobile Wallets** (On-the-go)
   - Phantom Mobile
   - Solflare Mobile
   - Convenient but requires caution

### Wallet Best Practices

#### Seed Phrase Security

Your seed phrase (recovery phrase) is the master key to your wallet:

✅ **DO:**
- Write it down on paper (never digital)
- Store in a secure location (safe, vault)
- Keep multiple copies in separate locations
- Use a steel backup for fire/water protection
- Memorize it if possible

❌ **NEVER:**
- Store in cloud storage
- Take screenshots
- Share with anyone
- Enter on suspicious websites
- Store in email or notes apps

#### Password Protection

- Use strong, unique passwords (20+ characters)
- Enable biometric authentication where available
- Use a password manager
- Change passwords periodically
- Never reuse passwords across platforms

#### Multi-Signature Wallets

For team treasuries or large holdings:

- Require multiple approvals for transactions
- Distribute signing authority among trusted parties
- Use time-locks for added security
- Implement spending limits

## Transaction Security

### Verifying Transactions

Before approving any transaction:

1. **Check the Recipient Address**
   - Verify first and last 4-6 characters
   - Use address books for frequent recipients
   - Beware of clipboard malware

2. **Review Transaction Details**
   - Amount being sent
   - Token type
   - Network fees
   - Any additional instructions

3. **Confirm Contract Interactions**
   - Only interact with verified contracts
   - Check contract address on blockchain explorer
   - Read contract permissions carefully

### Transaction Simulation

Our platform offers transaction preview:

```typescript
// Example simulation output
{
  action: "Token Transfer",
  from: "YourAddress",
  to: "RecipientAddress",
  amount: "100 MAT",
  fee: "0.000005 SOL",
  estimatedOutcome: "Success"
}
```

**Always review simulation results before confirming!**

## Smart Contract Security

### Understanding Permissions

When creating tokens, consider carefully:

#### Mint Authority

**Enabled:**
- ✅ Can create more tokens in the future
- ✅ Flexible supply management
- ❌ Potential for inflation
- ❌ Requires trust in authority holder

**Disabled (Recommended for most cases):**
- ✅ Fixed, immutable supply
- ✅ Creates scarcity
- ✅ Increases holder trust
- ❌ No flexibility to mint more

#### Freeze Authority

**Enabled:**
- ✅ Can freeze malicious accounts
- ✅ Regulatory compliance option
- ❌ Centralization concern
- ❌ Trust requirement

**Disabled (Recommended for decentralized projects):**
- ✅ True decentralization
- ✅ No account censorship
- ❌ Can't freeze stolen tokens

#### Update Authority

Controls metadata updates:

- Keep for legitimate updates (branding, links)
- Remove for fully immutable tokens
- Transfer to DAO for community governance

### Contract Audits

Before launching:

1. **Self-Audit Checklist**
   - Review all token parameters
   - Check authority settings
   - Verify metadata accuracy
   - Test on Devnet first

2. **Professional Audit** (for serious projects)
   - Hire reputable audit firms
   - Publish audit reports
   - Address all findings
   - Consider ongoing monitoring

## Privacy Best Practices

### Pseudonymity vs. Anonymity

**Solana Blockchain:**
- All transactions are public
- Wallet addresses are pseudonymous
- Transaction history is transparent
- Balances are visible

**Maintaining Privacy:**

1. **Use Multiple Wallets**
   - Separate personal and trading wallets
   - Different wallets for different purposes
   - Avoid linking identities

2. **Avoid Address Reuse**
   - Generate new addresses when possible
   - Limit exposure of main wallet

3. **Privacy-Focused Practices**
   - Avoid sharing wallet addresses publicly
   - Be cautious with wallet signatures
   - Consider privacy implications of NFT ownership

### Data Collection

Our platform:

✅ **We DO:**
- Use necessary cookies for functionality
- Collect anonymous usage analytics
- Store minimal required data

❌ **We DON'T:**
- Sell user data
- Track personal information
- Store seed phrases or private keys
- Require KYC (unless legally required)

## Common Security Threats

### 1. Phishing Attacks

**How They Work:**
- Fake websites mimicking legitimate platforms
- Emails requesting seed phrases
- Social media scams
- Fake customer support

**Protection:**
- Always verify URLs (bookmark official sites)
- Never share seed phrases
- Verify all communications through official channels
- Enable wallet security features

### 2. Malware

**Types:**
- Clipboard hijackers (change copied addresses)
- Keyloggers (record keyboard input)
- Screen capture malware
- Fake wallet applications

**Protection:**
- Use reputable antivirus software
- Keep systems updated
- Download only from official sources
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts

### 3. Social Engineering

**Common Tactics:**
- Impersonation of team members
- Urgent "help" requests
- Investment opportunities "too good to be true"
- Fake giveaways requiring seed phrases

**Protection:**
- Verify identities independently
- Be skeptical of unsolicited contact
- Never share private keys or seed phrases
- Check official channels for announcements

### 4. Rug Pulls

**Warning Signs:**
- Anonymous team
- No locked liquidity
- Unrealistic promises
- Unverified contracts
- Pressure to buy quickly

**Protection:**
- Research team credentials
- Check liquidity locks
- Verify token contracts
- Start with small amounts
- Monitor red flags

### 5. Smart Contract Exploits

**Risks:**
- Malicious contract code
- Unlimited token approvals
- Hidden backdoors
- Upgrade vulnerabilities

**Protection:**
- Only interact with verified contracts
- Review token approvals regularly
- Revoke unnecessary permissions
- Use contract scanning tools
