## Introduction to Token Trading

This guide covers everything you need to know about trading tokens created on our platform, including best practices, strategies, and safety tips.

## Understanding Token Types

### SPL Tokens

**Standard Program Library (SPL)** tokens are fungible tokens on Solana. Key characteristics:

- **Fungible** - Each token is identical and interchangeable
- **Divisible** - Can be split into smaller units (based on decimals)
- **Standard** - Follow Solana's SPL token standard
- **Fast & Cheap** - Benefit from Solana's high speed and low fees

### NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

NFTs are unique digital assets with individual properties:

- **Non-Fungible** - Each NFT is unique and cannot be divided
- **Metadata** - Contains attributes, images, and descriptions
- **Collectible** - Often used for art, gaming, and digital collectibles
- **Verifiable** - Ownership is transparent and immutable

## Creating Your First Token

### Token Minting Process

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Ensure you have enough SOL for transaction fees
   - Recommended: 0.5 SOL for testing on Devnet

2. **Fill Token Information**
   ```
   Name: My Awesome Token
   Symbol: MAT
   Decimals: 9 (standard)
   Total Supply: 1,000,000
   ```

3. **Upload Token Image**
   - Recommended size: 512x512px or larger
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
   - Max file size: 5MB

4. **Configure Token Settings**
   - **Freeze Authority** - Ability to freeze token accounts
   - **Mint Authority** - Ability to mint more tokens
   - **Update Authority** - Ability to update metadata

5. **Review & Confirm**
   - Double-check all information
   - Confirm transaction in your wallet
   - Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Token Economics Best Practices

**Initial Supply Considerations:**

- **Fixed Supply** - Creates scarcity (remove mint authority)
- **Flexible Supply** - Allows future minting (keep mint authority)
- **Deflationary** - Consider burn mechanisms

**Distribution Strategy:**

- Team allocation: 10-20%
- Community/Airdrop: 15-30%
- Liquidity Pool: 30-40%
- Treasury/Development: 20-30%

## Trading Strategies

### Market Orders

Execute trades immediately at current market price:

**Pros:**
- Instant execution
- Simple and straightforward
- No need to monitor price

**Cons:**
- Price may slip during execution
- Less control over final price

### Limit Orders

Set a specific price to buy or sell:

**Pros:**
- Control exact execution price
- Can set and forget
- Better for large orders

**Cons:**
- May not execute if price doesn't reach target
- Requires patience

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Invest fixed amounts at regular intervals:

**Benefits:**
- Reduces timing risk
- Smooths out volatility
- Disciplined approach
- Good for long-term positions

**Example:**
```
Instead of: Investing $1000 at once
Try: Investing $100 every week for 10 weeks
```

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

Never invest more than you can afford to lose:

- **Aggressive**: 5-10% of portfolio per position
- **Moderate**: 2-5% of portfolio per position
- **Conservative**: 1-2% of portfolio per position

### Stop-Loss Strategies

Protect your downside:

1. **Fixed Percentage** - Exit if price drops X%
2. **Trailing Stop** - Move stop-loss as price increases
3. **Support Levels** - Set stops below key support levels

### Diversification

Don't put all eggs in one basket:

- Spread investments across multiple tokens
- Mix established and new projects
- Consider different sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Gaming)

## Understanding Liquidity

### What is Liquidity?

Liquidity refers to how easily you can buy or sell a token without affecting its price.

**High Liquidity:**
- Large trading volumes
- Tight bid-ask spreads
- Minimal slippage
- Many buyers and sellers

**Low Liquidity:**
- Small trading volumes
- Wide bid-ask spreads
- High slippage
- Few market participants

### Checking Liquidity Before Trading

1. **Trading Volume** - Daily volume should be significant
2. **Order Book Depth** - Check buy/sell orders
3. **Number of Holders** - More holders = better distribution
4. **Liquidity Pool Size** - Larger pools = less slippage

## Transaction Settings

### Slippage Tolerance

Percentage of price movement you're willing to accept:

- **0.1-0.5%** - Highly liquid tokens
- **0.5-1%** - Normal conditions
- **1-3%** - New tokens or low liquidity
- **3%+** - High volatility or very low liquidity

⚠️ **Warning**: High slippage settings make you vulnerable to front-running!

### Priority Fees

Speed up transaction processing:

- **Low** - Standard processing (may be slower during congestion)
- **Medium** - Faster processing (recommended)
- **High** - Priority processing (for time-sensitive trades)

### Transaction Deadlines

Time limit for transaction execution:

- **5 minutes** - Standard setting
- **10 minutes** - For less volatile tokens
- **1-2 minutes** - For volatile markets

  freezeAuthority: "...", // Who can freeze accounts?
  supply: 1000000, // Total supply
  decimals: 9, // Token decimals
}
```

### Monitoring On-Chain Data
